## üöÄ&nbsp; Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Java 22 (GraalVM)

### Build

Package the Arconia CLI as a native executable:

```shell
./gradlew nativeCompile
```

The executable is located in `build/native/nativeCompile/arconia-cli`.
You can run it from there or add it as a new executable to your OS Path.
For example, on macOS and Linux:

```shell
sudo cp build/native/nativeCompile/arconia-cli /usr/local/bin/arconia
```

### Run

If you defined the Arconia CLI as an executable in your OS Path, you can run it as follows:

```shell
arconia help
```

Otherwise, you can point to the executable file (`build/native/nativeCompile/arconia-cli`).
