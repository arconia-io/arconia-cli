## üöÄ&nbsp; Getting Started

### Installation

[Download](https://github.com/arconia-io/arconia-cli/releases) the binary for your OS from the latest GitHub release, move it next to your other binaries and make it executable.

On macOS and Linux:

```shell
mv ~/Downloads/arconia-cli/bin/ /usr/local/bin/
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/arconia
```

On Windows, run the following commands from PowerShell:

```shell
# Create a new directory for arconia-cli
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "$env:ProgramFiles\arconia-cli" -Force

# Move the arconia.exe to the new directory
Move-Item -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\arconia-cli\bin\arconia.exe" -Destination "$env:ProgramFiles\arconia-cli\arconia.exe"

# Add the new directory to the system PATH
$currentPath = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "Machine")
$newPath = "$currentPath;$env:ProgramFiles\arconia-cli"
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $newPath, "Machine")

# Refresh the current PowerShell session's PATH
$env:Path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","Machine") + ";" + [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","User")
```

## üíª&nbsp; Development

### Prerequisites

* Java 22 (GraalVM)

### Build the CLI

Package the Arconia CLI as a native executable:

```shell
./gradlew nativeCompile
```

The executable is located in `build/native/nativeCompile/arconia-cli`.
You can run it from there or add it as a new executable to your OS Path.
For example, on macOS and Linux:

```shell
sudo cp build/native/nativeCompile/arconia-cli /usr/local/bin/arconia
```

### Run the CLI

If you defined the Arconia CLI as an executable in your OS Path, you can run it as follows:

```shell
arconia help
```

Otherwise, you can point to the executable file (`build/native/nativeCompile/arconia-cli`).
